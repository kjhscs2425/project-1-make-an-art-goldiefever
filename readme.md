# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like

peas in a pod with faces

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

the penline width
the size of the eyes and/or mouth

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?

3 ish circles for the peas
2-3 pods
eyes/mouths


4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

pod outlines
peas
expressions on the peas

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

the cirles for the peas
the eye placement within the peas, even if they have different expressions
the mouth placement within the peas, even if they have different expressions
the pod outlines
